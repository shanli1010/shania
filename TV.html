  "IT'S A TRAP"
  </p>

<p2>
This art piece was meant to represent the feeling of no escape. Portrayed here is an actress trying to escape the eyes of
the public. Due to the fact that she's struggling to do so, she is simply percieved as mentally ill and crazy. The background is set
in a 70's background to show that even as time passes, mental health is still seen as stigmatized. The piece was inspired by the #FreeBritney movement.
